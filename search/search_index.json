The software is designed to expose a GRASS GIS database and many GRASS GIS ^1 processing tools as REST service ^2 . Hence, access to GRASS resources like raster maps, space-time raster datasets, processing and analysis modules are available via URL. In addition Actinia allows the processing of cloud based data, for example all Landsat 4-8 scenes as well as all Sentinel-2A scenes in an ephemeral database. The computational results of ephemeral processing are available via object storage as GeoTIFF files. The actinia service consists of the actinia core that provides the basic but sophisticated processing service and actinia plugins that provide problem specific services like Sentinel-2 and Landsat NDVI computation, spatio-temporal statistical analysis and many more. To use actinia the user must have an understanding of the GRASS GIS concept ^3 of project, mapsets, raster maps, space-time datasets and modules. The URLs that provide access to the GRASS database reflect these concepts. Hence, the project, the mapset and the required raster map are part of the URL to access the service. What is REST? The Representational state transfer (REST) ^4 is an architectural style based on HTTP ^5 that uses GET ^6 , DELETE ^7 , POST ^8 and PUT ^9 methods to manipulate and receive resources with stateless operations. While GET requests can be send easily from a browser, POST, PUT or DELETE request can not. To access the full potential of actinia you will need a HTTP client, that talks all HTTP communication methods. Examples We will use the Unix shell and curl to access the REST API. First open a shell of choice (we use bash here) and setup the login information, the IP address and the port on which the actinia service is running, so you can simply change the IP and port if your server uses a different address: export ACTINIA_URL=https://actinia.mundialis.de/latest export AUTH='-u demouser:gu3st!pa55w0rd' # other user credentials can be provided in the same way Data management List all projects that are available in the actinia persistent database: curl ${AUTH} -X GET \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects\" List all mapsets in the project latlong_wgs84: curl ${AUTH} -X GET \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects/latlong_wgs84/mapsets\" List all raster layers in project latlong_wgs84 and mapset Sentinel2A: curl ${AUTH} -X GET \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects/latlong_wgs84/mapsets/Sentinel2A/raster_layers\" List all space-time raster datasets (STRDS) in project ECAD and mapset PERMANENT: curl ${AUTH} -X GET \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects/ECAD/mapsets/PERMANENT/strds\" List all raster map layers of the STRDS precipitation_1950_2013_yearly_mm: curl ${AUTH} -X GET \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects/ECAD/mapsets/PERMANENT/strds/precipitation_1950_2013_yearly_mm/raster_layers\" Landsat and Sentinel-2A NDVI computation This API call will compute the NDVI of the top of athmosphere (TOAR) corrected Landsat4 scene LC80440342016259LGN00: curl ${AUTH} -X POST \"${ACTINIA_URL}/landsat_process/LC80440342016259LGN00/TOAR/NDVI\" NDVI computation of Sentinel-2A scene S2A_MSIL1C_20170212T104141_N0204_R008_T31TGJ_20170212T104138: curl ${AUTH} -X POST \"${ACTINIA_URL}/sentinel2_process/ndvi/S2A_MSIL1C_20170212T104141_N0204_R008_T31TGJ_20170212T104138\" The results of the asynchronous computations are available as GeoTIFF file in a cloud storage for download.

First open a shell of choice (we use bash here) and setup the login information, the IP address and the port on which the actinia service is running, so you can simply change the IP and port if your server uses a different address: export ACTINIA_URL=https://actinia.mundialis.de/latest export AUTH='-u demouser:gu3st!pa55w0rd' # other user credentials can be provided in the same way Access to projects and mapsets in the persistent database The following API call lists all available projects in the actinia persistent database (the -i includes the HTTP response headers): curl ${AUTH} -X GET -i \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects\" The output should look similar to this: { \"projects\": [ \"latlong_wgs84\", \"ECAD\", \"nc_spm_08\" ], \"status\": \"success\" } To show the region settings and the projection of the GRASS GIS standard project nc_spm_08 the following REST call must be used: curl ${AUTH} -X GET \"${ACTINIA_URL}/projects/nc_spm_08/info\" The JSON response is the standard response of the actinia REST API. Most API calls respond using this JSON structure. The difference between API calls is the result part that is located in the JSON section with the name process_results . The response includes all steps that were executed to receive the projection information and the region information. It is located in the process_log section of the JSON response. In addition API specific information as well as the processing time are available in the response. To make the JSON response more readable you can use parsing-tools like jq. The output should look similar to this then: { \"accept_datetime\": \"2019-08-01 20:30:05.717499\", \"accept_timestamp\": 1564691405.7174985, \"api_info\": { \"endpoint\":

access the REST API. First open a shell of choice (we use bash here) and setup the login information, the IP address and the port on which the actinia service is running, so you can simply change the IP and port if your server uses a different address: export ACTINIA_URL=https://actinia.mundialis.de/latest export AUTH='-u demouser:gu3st!pa55w0rd' # other user credentials can be provided in the same way The NDVI is an important parameter that is derived from multi-spectral satellite images.

The process chain must be formulated in JSON. The processing is always performed in an ephemeral database. The computational environment is based on projects in the persistent database. If required, the ephemeral database can be moved into the persistent user database, so that the computational results can be used in further processing steps or visualized using the actinia rendering REST calls. The ephemeral database will be removed after computation. However, all raster and vector data that was generated during the processing can be exported using gdal/ogr specific datatypes and stored in an object storage, outside the actinia environment. Within a process chain we have read only access to all raster maps of the persistent database project that is used as computational environment. A process chain is a list of GRASS GIS modules ^1 that will be executed in serial, based on the order of the list. GRASS GIS modules are specified as process definitions ^2 that include the name of the command, the inputs and outputs], including import and export definitions as well as the module flags. The following example defines a single process that runs the GRASS GIS module r.slope.aspect ^3 to compute the slope for the raster map layer elev_ned_30m that is located in the mapset ^4 PERMANENT . The output of the module is named elev_ned_30m_slope and should be exported as a GeoTiff file. { \"module\": \"r.slope.aspect\", \"id\": \"r_slope_aspect_1\", \"inputs\": [ { \"param\": \"elevation\", \"value\": \"elev_ned_30m@PERMANENT\" } ], \"outputs\": [ { \"export\": { \"format\": \"GTiff\", \"type\": \"raster\" }, \"param\": \"slope\", \"value\": \"elev_ned_30m_slope\" } ], \"flags\": \"a\" } Import and export The actinia process chain supports the specification of URL's to raster layers in the input definition. The following process chain imports a raster map layer that is located in an object storage with the name elev_ned_30m_new and sets the computational region for the following processing step with the GRASS GIS module g.region ^5 . Then slope and aspect are computed with r.slope.aspect and specified for export as GeoTiff files. { \"list\": [ { \"module\": \"g.region\", \"id\": \"g_region_1\", \"inputs\": [ { \"import_descr\": { \"source\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/graas-geodata/elev_ned_30m.tif\", \"type\": \"raster\" }, \"param\": \"raster\", \"value\": \"elev_ned_30m_new\" } ], \"flags\": \"p\" }, { \"module\": \"r.slope.aspect\", \"id\": \"r_slope_aspect_1\", \"inputs\": [ { \"param\": \"elevation\", \"value\": \"elev_ned_30m_new\" } ], \"outputs\": [ { \"export\": { \"format\": \"GTiff\", \"type\": \"raster\" }, \"param\": \"slope\", \"value\": \"elev_ned_30m_new_slope\" } ], \"flags\": \"a\" } ], \"version\": \"1\" } Output parsing Many GRASS GIS modules produce textual output in form of lists, tables and key/value pairs. Actinia supports the analysis of this data and the parsing and transformation in JSON accessible data. For each GRASS GIS module the property \"stdout\" can be specified to transform the output of the module into a list of values, a key/value list or a table. The following options are available as format: \"kv\" parses the module output and creates key/value pairs \"list\" parses the module output and creates a list of values \"table\" parses the module output and creates a list of lists with values aka 2D array aka table Additionally the unique id that will be used in the response process result dictionary and the delimiter must be defined. The following process chain demonstrates all available approaches, to parse the stdout output of a module: { \"version\": 1, \"list\": [ { \"id\": \"1\", \"module\": \"g.region\", \"inputs\": [ {\"param\": \"raster\", \"value\": \"elevation@PERMANENT\"}, {\"param\": \"res\", \"value\": \"5000\"} ], \"stdout\": {\"id\": \"region\", \"format\": \"kv\", \"delimiter\": \"=\"}, \"flags\": \"g\"

Sentinel-2A NDVI process chain We will use the Unix shell and curl to access the REST API. First open a shell of choice (we use bash here) and setup the login information, the IP address and the port on which the actinia service is running, so you can simply change the IP and port if your server uses a different address: export ACTINIA_URL=https://actinia.mundialis.de/latest export AUTH='-u demouser:gu3st!pa55w0rd' # other user credentials can be provided in the same way We create a process chain that computes the NDVI from a Sentinel-2A scene based on the bands 8 and 4 with the GRASS GIS module r.mapcalc . We use the North Carolina sample project nc_spm_08 as processing environment and the computational region of sentinel band B04 for the NDVI processing. Then we calculate univariate statistics for the Sentinel-2A scene. The computed NDVI raster layer will be exported as geotiff file that can be accessed via an URL.

The process chain must be formulated in JSON. The processing is always performed in an ephemeral database. The computational environment is based on projects in the persistent database. If required, the ephemeral database can be moved into the persistent user database, so that the computational results can be used in further processing steps or visualized using the actinia rendering REST calls. The ephemeral database will be removed after computation. However, all raster and vector data that was generated during the processing can be exported using gdal/ogr specific datatypes and stored in an object storage, outside the actinia environment. Within a process chain we have read only access to all raster maps of the persistent database project that is used as computational environment. A process chain is a list of GRASS GIS modules ^1 that will be executed in serial, based on the order of the list. GRASS GIS modules are specified as process definitions ^2 that include the name of the command, the inputs and outputs], including import and export definitions as well as the module flags. The following example defines a single process that runs the GRASS GIS module r.slope.aspect ^3 to compute the slope for the raster map layer elev_ned_30m that is located in the mapset ^4 PERMANENT .
